# Wordpress, VUE & Mapbox.
Thanks to [EvanAgee](https://github.com/EvanAgee) ❤️ for his [vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter](https://github.com/EvanAgee/vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter) !
Refactored to use a vue-cli build process.

There is still lots of work do be done :)

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
